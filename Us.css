third month of the year,
eigth day. The first thing i remember is you called me "My gift from God" since it was your birthday.<br>I probably won't forget about that cuz you maybe are joking that time but for me, it was the sweetest phrase. You changed the way i see love songs, from cringe, to suddenly meaningful.</center> <br>
 <br><center><img src="1.jpg" height="300" width="500"><img src="3.jpg" height="300" width="500"></center><center>We played almost everyday,
and i had so muuuuch fun. That screenshot is the oldest ml screenshot that we have in our convo. <br><br><center>My life is so messy back then,
but you lead me to the right path. We made promises along the way,
one which i will never ever forget.<br>"Hanggang next century",
and that time,
as cringe as it was,
as immature as i am,
I made that promise,
My Goal in Life. I wonder if that was me being immature,
<br>if it's my "puppy love" phase or it was just me, and my genuine love. "Fascinating", that' s how i will call those times.</centerr><br><br><br><center><img src="promise.jpg" height="300" width="400"></center><center>Not the exact conversation,
I couldn't find it.<br>
 I love loveee it everytime we brought this thing up.</center><br><br><center>As young as we are back then,
we don't really know how to express our feelings, how to handle things properly, how... to keep each other.<br> It lasted for only 2 months. It crushed me. "So this is what it feels like to be broken" And that time, that time is the very first time that i cried for a girl.<br> Clips from tiktok says that it' s great,
i should be proud,
cuz what i feel is real. But i don't want that feeling, i don' t want to be proud of myself in exchanged of lossing you.</center><br><br><center><img src="4.jpg" height="300" width="400"></center><br><center><p style="font-family:Papyrus">You always scold me everytime you remember it. Because it seems like it's okay for me to  let you go. But the truth Aime? That time, I couldn' t process it properly,
<br>I couldn't accept it. But you, you' re different when you're really mad, i can' t talk to you properly. I can only pretend that time.<br>Every moment you say that i should calm you down everytime you're mad or everytime you want it to end because you don' t really mean it,
<br>it always made me sad,
knowing that i can't do it. Cuz i know you, if you' re already decided. Even i couldn't stop you.</center><br>
 <center>Me,
being emotionally weak,
used someone to move on,
to forget,
to be "happy" . Months have passed and this boy learns to love that<br>someone without a selfish reason. A rusty relationship. This someone found another man to satisfy her,
and so this boy is left alone again.</center <center>But oh,
how the God is so good with me. Just days after that break up. "The one that got away" cameback.<br>It's funny actually, cuz it started in an "messenger note", i remember i am not sure if you were talking to me so i used Japanese alphabet in my note reply. </center><br>
 <center><img src="5.jpg" height="300" width="400"></center><br><center>I can sense that we're both shy that time. January 07, 2022, a very special day. I used that date as my g-cash pin code and in other things as well.<br> Don' t get me wrong,
I didn't use you as a rebound and pretty sure you understand it too. You were sooo sweet that time, you told me everything<br> that happened in the past 7 months. I was shocked in some of your stories. I find that one specific story so interesting, the "First guy and the Secondary guy".<br> Well that time i didn' t know everything about you,
but to be honest at some point i had the idea that i am that First guy. But i didn't think too much of it because first,<br> i was moving on, second there' s so many guys who likes you,
and maybe you have a history with one of them. We send tiktok videos to each other,
<br>i rememberrr one day as i was looking at my tiktok followers,
i saw your account in the list. I was like "what the heck she's following me? since when?" <br>and so i instanly follow you back. I remember you have 900+followers that time but you removed all of them and you left my account there:>>>.<br>I was so shy to talk to you because i thought you think that i ignored you. We played again almost everyday and slowly<br>becoming more close and comfortable with each other. Re-reading our convo back then pushes me more to take you back. Valentine's day arrive, i didn' t<br>greet you becausse i was so shy. Again shyness my weakness,
really wish i overcome that long ago. You greet me,
i remember you posted,
and you<br>remove right away. I pretended that i didn't see it and i never brought it up. Oh, i remember one time you told me a made up story (yes i will call it a made up story)<br> about someone' s home or resting place and other people. I don't know but the first thing that came in my mind is you' re afraid that maybe i was using you as a rebound.<br>Yet i didn't say it, I didn' t comfort you or reassured you because what if it's not what you think? What if i' m just being assuming? But now,
i wish i did.<br>This time is the time when you always made ml editss of us,
i find it so cuteee,
i always save it and put in "my favorites" folder,
there's also edits about our convo<br> and you always put it in your facebook stories, that' s so sweeeeet,
but i didn't tell you that. </center><br>

that time was the peak of "Ikaw lang",
"Binibini",
and "Unang sayaw" .<br>Aaaa those songs delivers a different feeling when you are inlove and everytime i listen to those songs i think of you.<br>This is also the time when you finally made me do a voice mall,
and it feels so good to know that you think my voice is perfect(even though you probably just said it to boost my confidence). </center><br><br><br><center>August 13,
2022 the day that we finally confess. Well,
we didn't really confess cuz like we know it ever since. It' s more like,
we finally express it.<br>You finally called me "Sho" HAHAHAHAHAHA. You can't imagine how happy i was back then, i was swinging my feet in the air, and couldn' t stop smiling.<br>Kisses,
I love loveee loveeee your kisses. I ask for it everytime.</center><br><center><img src="sho.jpg" height="300" width="400"></center><center>The butterflies in my stomach that time aaaa.</center><br><br><br><center>And you sent me this to reassure it's me, kilig muchh aaa.</center>
 <center><video src="h.mp4" height="300" width="400" controls autoplay muted></center><center><video src="o.mp4" height="300" width="400" controls autoplay muted></center><br><center>We finally ask the things that we want to ask for so long,
say the things that we keep,
tell you,
that i love you.</center><br><br><center>There are time's that we are not so happy. Especially when face to face school came. Lots of arguments, and we didn' t manage to keep it.<br>I was suffering from overthinking. Been with it for weeks. You are busy with school things and so am i. We ended it. It hurts,
it freaking hurts.<br>I just keep my self busy with school things,
more school things,
i joined clubs,
stay up in school late,
went out with friends,
just to distract myself.</center><br><br><br><center>March 09,
2023. You cameback,
the way that we get back with each other is so so so funny. March 08,
2023,
12:00am i greeted you happy birthday in ml bio.<br>Not expecting it but when i visited you back then i saw your bio,
it says "miss u balik ka na" . I didn't think much of it that time and few hours later,<br> i think 2am I visited you again and i saw your bio it says "thank you" so i removed my bio. When i woke up morning of that day i opened my ml account and stalked you,<br> I saw your bio and it says "missu balik ka na nga e", so I was like "huh? is she talking to me?" The chills that time, and it was morning i was about to take a bath,<br> so cold and what i saw made it more cold aaa. I stalked your fb account and the bio is "couple pfp tayo", and the male version of your pfp that time is posted in your featured,<br> "is it for me????" My mind is racing and i don' t know what to feel. "Fuck it, I'll do it" . I can't focus in school that time thinking about what just i did, I risked it!<br> And oh lord after so many hours that feels like eternity, i confirmed it, i don' t remember what you said but i was sure,
i was so sure,
<br>IT WAS FOR ME HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA. We talked in bio til evening,
arguing who will start the convo,
then midnight the moment has come.</center><center><img src="b.jpg" height="300" width="400"></center><br><center>I was so happy ofcourse,
i tried to make it as normal as i can. I don't want it to be awkward, we talk about everything we did in the past 4 months.<br> You said you stalked my mom' s fb account and i find it so funny cuz almost all of girls do that.<br>Well in our case,
i guess that's your best option cuz I am not active in facebook and i unfriended you.<br>
 We become for soft,
we cared for it more than we did before. We played everyday,
we talked everyday,
we sent tiktoks to each other<br>and became more expressive with our feelings. You do not do edits anymore and i kinda miss it so i ask you for one. You did it and it made me happy.</center><br><center><img src="c.jpg" height="300" width="500"><img src="f.jpg" height="300" width="500"></center><br><center><img src="d.jpg" height="300" width="500"><img src="m.jpg" height="300" width="500"></center><br><center>Time is so fast when we're together. Time flies so fast when I am happy. I didn' t realize it's already October, it has been 7 months since March. <br> In that seven months we grew, we became so close. We spent all time with together. We got to know each other better. We also become toxic. <br> We become relaxed, chill. I do not know exactly what happened. It ended. We ended.</center>
 <br><br><br><center>The words that i said that night,
I deeply regret it. I do not know what I was saying that time,
I let my emotion get a hold of me. I hurt you.<br>I didn't considered your feelings. I didn' t think of my feelings. I didn't think of my promises. I' m a piece of garbage.</center><br><center>Even when we were still together i did a lot of bad things and sometimes i invade your personal life,
<br>sometimes i do not believe what you says and create my own conclusion. I know I'm that guy Aime. I know I don' t deserve you.<br>I know there could be another time for us. But i also know that there could be not.</center><br><center>I'm very sorry for what I did, I really do. Aime, I don' t wanna loss you again. I'm afraid. I don' t want another man to be with you.<br>I don't want them to experience what it feels to be with you. I don' t want any of them to have your tiniest attention. I only want you for me.<br>I want us to last for eternity. I want a future with you. I want to achieve all of my dreams with you. I want to grow with you.<br>I want you to be the mother of my future children. I want to marry you.</center><center>Comeback to me,
I'll change for the better. I' ll prove that "Sho is the best" . It won't be like before.<br> You' ll have what's supposed to be yours, I won' t take anything from you.<br>I won't be that paranoid, overthinker, garbage man like before.</center><br>
 <br><center>I know i said this before but,
I will change for what we could have,
for us. I will change for myself. I will be better for you.<br>Can i please take the love of my life back?</center>
