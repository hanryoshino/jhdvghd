<center> We first met way back 2021, third month of the year, eigth day. The first thing i remember is you called me "My gift from God" since it was your birthday.<br> I probably won't forget about that cuz you maybe are joking that time but for me, it was the sweetest phrase. You changed the way i see love songs, from cringe, to suddenly meaningful.</center> <br>
<br>

<center> We played almost everyday, and i had so muuuuch fun. That screenshot is the oldest ml screenshot that we have in our convo.
<br>
<br>
<center> My life is so messy back then, but you lead me to the right path. We made promises along the way, one which i will never ever forget.<br> "Hanggang next century", and that time, as cringe as it was, as immature as i am, I made that promise, My Goal in Life. 
 I wonder if that was me being immature, <br> if it's my "puppy love" phase or it was just me, and my genuine love. "Fascinating", that's how i will call those times.</centerr><br>
<br>
<br>
<center><img src="promise.jpg" height="300" width="400" ></center>
<center>Not the exact conversation, I couldn't find it.<br>
I love loveee it everytime we brought this thing up.</center><br>
<br>
<center> As young as we are back then, we don't really know how to express our feelings, how to handle things properly, how... to keep each other.<br> It lasted for only 2 months. It crushed me. "So this is what it feels like to be broken" And that time, that time is the very first time that i cried for a girl.<br> Clips from tiktok says that it's great, i should be proud, cuz what i feel is real. But i don't want that feeling, i don't want to be proud of myself in exchanged of lossing you.</center><br>
<br>

<br>
<center><p style="font-family:Papyrus"> You always scold me everytime you remember it. Because it seems like it's okay for me to  let you go. But the truth Aime? That time, I couldn't process it properly,<br> I couldn't accept it. But you, you're different when you're really mad, i can't talk to you properly. I can only pretend that time.<br> Every moment you say that i should calm you down everytime you're mad or everytime you want it to end because you don't really mean it,<br> it always made me sad, knowing that i can't do it. Cuz i know you, if you're already decided. Even i couldn't stop you.</center><br>
<center> Me, being emotionally weak, used someone to move on, to forget, to be "happy". Months have passed and this boy learns to love that<br> someone without a selfish reason. A rusty relationship. This someone found another man to satisfy her, and so this boy is left alone again.</center
<center> But oh, how the God is so good with me. Just days after that break up. "The one that got away" cameback.<br> It's funny actually, cuz it started in an "messenger note", i remember i am not sure if you were talking to me so i used Japanese alphabet in my note reply. </center><br>

<br>
<center> I can sense that we're both shy that time. January 07, 2022, a very special day. I used that date as my g-cash pin code and in other things as well.<br> Don't get me wrong, I didn't use you as a rebound and pretty sure you understand it too. You were sooo sweet that time, you told me everything<br> that happened in the past 7 months. I was shocked in some of your stories. I find that one specific story so interesting, the "First guy and the Secondary guy".<br> Well that time i didn't know everything about you, but to be honest at some point i had the idea that i am that First guy. But i didn't think too much of it because first,<br> i was moving on, second there's so many guys who likes you, and maybe you have a history with one of them. We send tiktok videos to each other,<br> i rememberrr one day as i was looking at my tiktok followers, i saw your account in the list. I was like "what the heck she's following me? since when?"<br> and so i instanly follow you back. I remember you have 900+ followers that time but you removed all of them and you left my account there:>>>.<br> I was so shy to talk to you because i thought you think that i ignored you. We played again almost everyday and slowly<br> becoming more close and comfortable with each other. Re-reading our convo back then pushes me more to take you back. Valentine's day arrive, i didn't<br> greet you becausse i was so shy. Again shyness my weakness, really wish i overcome that long ago. You  greet me, i remember you posted, and you<br> remove right away. I pretended that i didn't see it and i never brought it up. Oh, i remember one time you told me a made up story (yes i will call it a made up story)<br> about someone's home or resting place and other people. I don't know but the first thing that came in my mind is you're afraid that maybe i was using you as a rebound.<br> Yet i didn't say it, I didn't comfort you or reassured you because what if it's not what you think? What if i'm just being assuming? But now, i wish i did.<br> This time is the time when you always made ml editss of us, i find it so cuteee, i always save it and put in "my favorites" folder, there's also edits about our convo<br> and you always put it in your facebook stories, that's so sweeeeet, but i didn't tell you that. </center><br>

<center> This one is my favorite.</center>
<center> I remember, that time was the peak of "Ikaw lang", "Binibini", and "Unang sayaw".<br> Aaaa  those songs delivers a different feeling when you are inlove and everytime i listen to those songs i think of you.<br> This is also the time when you finally made me do a voice mall,  and it feels so good to know that you think my voice is perfect(even though you probably just said it to boost my confidence). </center><br>
<br>
<br>
<center> August 13, 2022 the day that we finally confess. Well, we didn't really confess cuz like we know it ever since. It's more like, we finally express it.<br> You finally called me "Sho" HAHAHAHAHAHA. You can't imagine how happy i was back then, i was swinging my feet in the air, and couldn't stop smiling.<br> Kisses, I love loveee loveeee your kisses. I ask for it everytime.</center>
<br>
<center><img src="sho.jpg" height="300" width="400" ></center>
<center> The butterflies in my stomach that time aaaa.</center>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center> And you sent me this to reassure it's me, kilig muchh aaa.</center>
<center> <video src="h.mp4" height="300" width="400" controls autoplay muted ></center>
<center> <video src="o.mp4" height="300" width="400" controls autoplay muted ></center>
<br>
<center> We finally ask the things that we want to ask for so long, say the things that we keep, tell you, that i love you.</center>
<br>
<br>
<center> There are time's that we are not so happy. Especially when face to face school came. Lots of arguments, and we didn't manage to keep it.<br> I was suffering from overthinking. Been with it for weeks. You are busy with school things and so am i. We ended it. It hurts, it freaking hurts.<br> I just keep my self busy with school things, more school things, i joined clubs, stay up in school late, went out with friends, just to distract myself.</center>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>March 09, 2023. You cameback, the way that we get back with each other is so so so funny. March 08, 2023, 12:00am i greeted you happy birthday in ml bio.<br> Not expecting it but when i visited you back then i saw your bio, it says "miss u balik ka na". I didn't think much of it that time and few hours later,<br> i think 2am I visited you again and i saw your bio it says "thank you" so i removed my bio. When i woke up morning of that day i opened my ml account and stalked you,<br> I saw your bio and it says "missu balik ka na nga e", so I was like "huh? is she talking to me?" The chills that time, and it was morning i was about to take a bath,<br> so cold and what i saw made it more cold aaa. I stalked your fb account and the bio is "couple pfp tayo", and the male version of your pfp that time is posted in your featured,<br> "is it for me????" My mind is racing and i don't know what to feel. "Fuck it, I'll do it". I can't focus in school that time thinking about what just i did, I risked it!<br> And oh lord after so many hours that feels like eternity, i confirmed it, i don't remember what you said but i was sure, i was so sure,<br> IT WAS FOR ME HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA. We talked in bio til evening, arguing who will start the convo, then midnight the moment has come.</center>
<center><img src="b.jpg" height="300" width="400" ></center>
<br>
<center> I was so happy ofcourse, i tried to make it as normal as i can. I don't want it to be awkward, we talk about everything we did in the past 4 months.<br> You said you stalked my mom's fb account and i find it so funny cuz almost all of girls do that.<br> Well in our case, i guess that's your best option cuz I am not active in facebook and i unfriended you.<br>
We become for soft, we cared for it more than we did before. We played everyday, we talked everyday, we sent tiktoks to each other<br> and became more expressive with our feelings. You do not do edits anymore and i kinda miss it so i ask you for one. You did it and it made me happy.</center>

<br>
<center> Time is so fast when we're together. Time flies so fast when I am happy. I didn't realize it's already October, it has been 7 months since March. <br> In that seven months we grew, we became so close. We spent all time with together. We got to know each other better. We also become toxic. <br> We become relaxed, chill. I do not know exactly what happened. It ended. We ended.</center>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center> The words that i said that night, I deeply regret it. I do not know what I was saying that time, I let my emotion get a hold of me. I hurt you.<br> I didn't considered your feelings. I didn't think of my feelings. I didn't think of my promises. I'm a piece of garbage.</center>
<br> 
<center> Even when we were still together i did a lot of bad things and sometimes i invade your personal life,<br> sometimes i do not believe what you says and create my own conclusion. I know I'm that guy Aime. I know I don't deserve you.<br> I know there could be another time for us. But i also know that there could be not.</center>
<br>
<center> I'm very sorry for what I did, I really do. Aime, I don't wanna loss you again. I'm afraid. I don't want another man to be with you.<br> I don't want them to experience what it feels to be with you. I don't want any of them to have your tiniest attention. I only want you for me.<br> I want us to last for eternity. I want a future with you. I want to achieve all of my dreams with you. I want to grow with you.<br> I want you to be the mother of my future children. I want to marry you.</center>
<center> Comeback to me, I'll change for the better. I'll prove that "Sho is the best". It won't be like before.<br> You'll have what's supposed to be yours, I won't take anything from you.<br> I won't be that paranoid, overthinker, garbage man like before.</center><br>
<br>
<center> I know i said this before but, I will change for what we could have, for us. I will change for myself. I will be better for you.<br>
Can i please take the love of my life back?</center>
